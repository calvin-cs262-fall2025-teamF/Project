## ðŸ’¼ Business Case  
The business case for Poros rests on the inefficiencies of existing job search platforms, which tend to be fragmented and reactive.  

- **Job boards** (Indeed, LinkedIn): Offer access to postings but lack end-to-end guidance.  
- **Resume builders** (Zety, Resume.io): Focus narrowly on formatting rather than strategic tailoring for each application.  
- **Application trackers** (Huntr): Provide organization but donâ€™t integrate proactive recommendations or AI-driven personalization.

## ðŸŒ€ Why Poros is Different  
Poros uniquely integrates these functionalities into one cohesive system, helping users to:  
- Find opportunities  
- Chart a strategic plan  
- Optimize their materials  
- Apply quickly with confidence
